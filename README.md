# Unlzx

A cross-platform, fully re-entrant C++ library for LZX decompression.

This project provides a modern C++ library and command-line tool to integrate LZX decompression into any project. It is designed to be fully re-entrant, making it suitable for multi-threaded environments.

The code was originally authored by Erik Meusel, forked from v1.1 of the `unlzx.c` file (03.04.01).

## Credits & Copyright

The core LZX decompression logic was originally authored by **Erik Meusel**. While this repository improves and modernizes the code for C++ and provides a re-entrant library interface, the copyright for the original implementation remains with the original author.

## Usage as a Library

You can include this project as a C++ library to handle LZX decompression in your own applications. 

### Features

*   **Fully Re-entrant:** Safe for concurrent use in multi-threaded applications.
*   **C++ Integration:** Modern C++ interfaces for easy integration.
*   **Cross-platform:** Compatible with multiple operating systems.
